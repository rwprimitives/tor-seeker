Introduction
============

**TorSeeker** is a command line tool and a Python module that can be used to query information about Tor relays.

From the command line, queries can be performed relatively easy by using a two letter country code or via one or multiple Tor IP addresses.

As a Python module, **TorSeeker** offers a reasonable and easy approach for querying information about Tor relays from within your own Python script or module.

Internet connection is required in order to perform Tor network queries.
